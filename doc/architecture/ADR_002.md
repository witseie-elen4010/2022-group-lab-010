# ADR 2: Testing using Jest

## Context

The app requires a unit testing framework for test driven development and continuous integration/deployment. This requires a testing system to be set up.

## Decision

The Jest test framework will be used, a "\_\_tests\_\_" folder will be created to hold test functions. Jest coverage tests will be used to ensure code coverage. supertest will be used to test express routes without an http server in the local environment.

## Status: Accepted

## Consequences

Testing is required for continuous integration/deployment as well as code quality. Future code will need to be written with tests in mind, exisitng code may need refactoring.

# ADR 1: Web app structure using express and node

## Context

The project brief requires the web app to be built using node and the express web server. The structure of the code used in the repo needs to be set in order for work to begin.

## Decision

The source code repository is organized in the style of a standard express web app as created by the "express-generator --no-view command".

Further structuring is handled according to the convention shown [here](https://medium.com/codechef-vit/a-better-project-structure-with-express-and-node-js-c23abc2d736f)

This includes seperate folders for

- Controllers - `controllers`
- Routes  - `routes`
- Models - `models`
- Middleware - `middleware`
- Utils - `utils`
- Templates - `templates`

## Status: Accepted

## Consequences

The choice of underlying web server will affect all aspects of the project moving forward. This however is as required by the project requirements and is thus accepted as the only choice. Accepted design structure should improve maintainability and adhere to accepted practice, but this may need to be revisited as the project continues.
